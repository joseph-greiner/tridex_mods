# Front Skirt modifications
 Two of the revo_nozzle_holder_skirt sections fit in the front of the Tridex when using Trident 250 front skirts. This takes up all the space for a 250 build Tridex, a 300 build will have a gap large enough for the USB skirt panel. This allows USB extensions to be used to bring the USB from the raspberry Pi out to the skirt for easy access.
