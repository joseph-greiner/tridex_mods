# Adjustable carriages for Tridex
 Replacement carriages for Tridex with a physical adjustment.

The mounting on the carraiges are an exact replacement for the CW2 and Stealthburner mounts, so any CW2 compatable tool head will mount on this. The carriage fits any probe mount that fits on the stock carriage. The tool mounting is approximately 5mm towards the Y minimum direction from the stock carriage. So there may be some loss of travel along the Y axis.

The carriage portion could be used with any tool mount desired, all it needs is a dovetail on the rear that slides into the carriage with a light press fit (see the CAD for dimensions).

The design works well with [Double Tap](https://github.com/ShadowSteve1/Double-TAP-for-Tridex) installed on T0 for probing, as the tool mounting plane is designed to match up with it along the Y axis.
