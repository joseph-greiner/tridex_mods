Here is the configuration I use for Prusa Slicer 2.7

It has 3 Tridex printers,
Primary mode, Copy mode, and Mirror mode. All have 0.4 nozzles, the only change is the start gcode and custom tool change gcode.

The bed size is 300x300. Adjust for your bed size.

There are two print profile, Quality and Speed.

bed_textures contains the images I use in Prusa Slicer for my bed textures. The PNG files are what you should use in Prusa Slicer, the SVG files are the editable source files for the textures that can be easily edited in Inkscape.
