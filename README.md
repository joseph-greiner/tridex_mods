# Tridex Mods
 Here are modifications I have made for my Tridex, I decided to gather them into a separate repository as I am not sure what should realistically be merged into the main Tridex repository.

## [Adjustable Carriages](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/adjustable_carriage)
 Optional physically adjustable carriages that supports CW2 and Stealtherburner compatible hardware.

## [Docs](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/docs)
 <b>frame_and_rails_calc.ods:</b> An easier to understand Tridex frame, rails, and belt calculator. Includes Misumi order numbers for extrusions.<br>
 <b>parametric_panels.FCStd:</b> Parametric FreeCAD document that scales the panels for selected bed and parking sizes. Export the sketches as DXF and send off to your preferred seller.

## [Dragon Burner Cowls](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/dragon_burner_cowls)
 Remix of [chirpy2605 Dragon Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) tool head to have identifiers on the front face.

## [Drive Frame Umbilical Mount](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/drive_frames_umbilical_mounts)
 Added mounts for PG7 glands to the left and right drive frames.

## [Front Skirts](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/front_skirts)
 Addition of Revo nozzle holders and USB access to the front skirt.

## [Printer configuration](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/printer_configuration)
 Full set of Klipper IDEX macros to enable full use of your printer with minimal configuration on your part. Works best with my Prusa Slicer configuration. 

## [Slicer Configuration](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/slicer_configuration)
 This is my current Prusa Slicer configuration, including any custom gcode that helps the macros in the printer configuration work.

## [Thick Wiper modification](https://github.com/joseph-greiner/tridex_mods/tree/main/thick_wiper_mod)
 Modification for the thick wiper on the wiper arm to allow a loop of silicone instead of a block. This allows for easier adjustment for preventing ooze.
