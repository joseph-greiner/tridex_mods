# Tridex Mods
 Here are modifications I have made for my Tridex, I decided to gather them into a separate repository as I am not sure what should realistically be merged into the main Tridex repository.

## Adjustable Carriages
 Optional physically adjustable carriages that supports CW2 and Stealtherburner compatible hardware.

## Dragon Burner Cowls
 Remix of [chirpy2605 Dragon Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) tool head to have identifiers on the front face.
