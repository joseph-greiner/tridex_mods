# Tridex Mods
 Here are modifications I have made for my Tridex, I decided to gather them into a separate repository as I am not sure what should realistically be merged into the main Tridex repository.

## Adjustable Carriages
 Optional physically adjustable carriages that supports CW2 and Stealtherburner compatible hardware.

## Docs
 frame_and_rails_calc.ods: An easier to understand Tridex frame, rails, and belt calculator. Includes Misumi order numbers for extrusions.
 parametric_panels.FCStd: Parametric FreeCAD document that scales the panels for selected bed and parking sizes. Export the sketches as DXF and send off to your preferred seller.

## Dragon Burner Cowls
 Remix of [chirpy2605 Dragon Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner) tool head to have identifiers on the front face.

## Front Skirts
 Addition of Revo nozzle holders and USB access to the front skirt.

## Printer configuration
 Full set of Klipper IDEX macros to enable full use of your printer with minimal configuration on your part. Works best with my Prusa Slicer configuration 

## Slicer Configuration
 This is my current Prusa Slicer configuration, including any custom gcode that helps the macros in the printer configuration work.

## Thick Wiper modification
 Modification for the thick wiper on the wiper arm to allow a loop of silicone instead of a block. This allows for easier adjustment for preventing ooze.
