# Drive frames with umbilical mounts
 Replacement drive frames for Tridex with a PG7 mount and passthrough for a bowden tube.<p>

 Each PG7 mount piece has a blank version and a version that labels that side with the tool head number. T0 is on the right because that is the location of the x_stepper. T1 is on the left because the dual_carriage stepper is on that side. Additionally with the spools mounted on the inside of the chamber, I found it best for the bowden routing to have them setup this way. Spool on the left side goes to the tool head on the right and vice versa.<p>

 The [a]_drive_frame_mid.stl is unchanged from the standard Tridex files, but I added an insert for the Voron logo so if they are printed on a printer with multi-color abilities they can be printed that way.<p>

 Getting the inserts lined up did not work well for me when exporting raw STL files, so I lined them up in Prusa Slicer and saved the projects as .3mf files for ease of use.<p>
